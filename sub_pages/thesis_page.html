        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <p class="abstract">
            Infectious viral diseases that are newly developing or returning
 have threatened humanity throughout history. Infectious diseases sig
nificantly impact the economics and quality of life of a nation. The
 threat of infectious diseases has increased considerably due to a multi
tude of factors. The infection rate can be significantly reduced if it is
 addressed beforehand. Human movement and infectious diseases are
 strongly intertwined. Human migration can influence the dynamics of
 infectious diseases by introducing infections into vulnerable groups or
 increasing the frequency of interactions between infected and suscep
tible people. Researchers have used this information to battle infec
tious diseases. Recent studies have focused on post-pandemic situa
tions. However, early detection of links across different zones can help
 with disease prevention. This research exercises the exposure level of
 different nearby areas of a specific region to get insight into the pro
gression of infectious diseases. We introduced a method to compute
 risk score considering the risk probability to each node in an area.
 This risk score assesses the level of risk in a particular zone due to an
 outbreak. The score indicates the vulnerability level of a zone. The
 performance analysis reveals that the suggested model performs well
 on large data sets and significantly contributes to the early detection
 of an outbreak’s spreading path.
